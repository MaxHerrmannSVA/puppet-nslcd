## Overview

This module installs and configured nslcd to get pam/nss data from ldap.

## Module Description

This module allows you to install and configure the nslcd daemon (and its dependencies), to provide ldap support for 
PAM and NSS.

## Setup

### What nslcd affects

* `nslcd` package and service
* `/etc/nslcd.conf`

## Usage

Simply include/contain/required/declare the nslcd class.
It includes a few sane defaults, so it should work out of the box.
However, we recommend that you declare the class and override a few parameters:

* In the module

```
class { 'nslcd':
  ldap_uris => ['ldap://ldap01.mycompany.com:389','ldap://ldap02.mycompany.com:389'],
  ldap_search_base => 'dc=company,dc=com'
}
```

* In hieradata

```
nslcd::ldap_uris:
  - 'ldap://ldap01.company.com:389'
  - 'ldap://ldap02.company.com:389'
nslcd::ldap_search_base: 'dc=company,dc=com'
```

## Reference

*todo*

## Limitations

The module has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 8, Debian 9 and Puppet 4.10.
It should work with Puppet 4.x.

For additional OS support, you should contribute it back upstream!

The module doesn't support setting the `rootbinddn` and `rootbindpw` attributes yet, it will be added in a next version.
